# churn
Customer churn 
Churn is the measure of how a customer's leave over a  period. 
It’s used to measure how much revenue you lose through customer cancellations.
It’s also used to measure the number of users or accounts that cease using your products or services. 
In either case, churn represents the attrition rate of your customer base. 
The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every online business. Besides the direct loss of revenue that results from a customer abandoning the business, the costs of initially acquiring that customer may not have already been covered by the customer’s spending to date.
(In other words, acquiring that customer may have actually been a losing investment.) 
Furthermore, it is always more difficult and expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain a current paying customer.
